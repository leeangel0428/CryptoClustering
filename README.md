# Introduction
Hello viewer and welcome to my submission for Challenge 19 aka the cryptoclustering challenge. For context, at the time of writing this, I am enrolled in the Data Analytics and Visualizations bootcamp with the University of MN. We are assigned a challenge homework per module. This is Module 19's challenge on unsupervised learning. I am using a windows/PC laptop.

# Overview
Description: Use knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

1) Prepare the data

2) Find the Best Value for k using the original scaled dataframe

3) Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the original scaled data

4) Optimize cluster with principal component analysis

5) Find the best value for k using the PCA data

6) Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the PCA data

# Repository Structure
In this repository, you will find the Starter_Code folder that holds the Resources folder and the Crypto_Clustering jupyter notebook. The Resources folder holds the crypto_market_data.csv. 

### Troubleshooting: 

I wasn't sure which way to go about contrasting the two scatter plots so I tried it two different ways. I believe the second way comparing both charts on top of each other is better than trying to combine them.

# Additional Information
Everything used was retained information gathered from my classes and class activities. As always shout out to my bootcamp TAs Sam and Randy for all their help answering my questions during office hours, my instructor Hunter for always being clear in his articulation of the course material, and my classmates for their encouragement and support.
